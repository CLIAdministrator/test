You put this stuff over grass seed and grass grows!  Buy the Original from the Inventor of Biodegradable Erosion Control Blankets&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;American Excelsior Company is the inventor of biodegradable erosion control blankets. Developed in the early 1960s, Curlex excelsior blankets are specifically designed to actually promote ideal growing conditions for grass seed, while simultaneously protecting topsoil from wind and water erosion. Curlex excelsior blankets have long passed the test of time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By design, Curlex blankets have a built-in swell factor - wet curled excelsior fibers slightly expand in thickness and interlock to form a strong, fiber matrix. This allows the fibers to provide intimate contact with local terrain. Water flow is trained to follow the curled fiber matrix. The roughness of the curled excelsior matrix slows the velocity to a point where gravity takes over, which allows moisture to slowly seep into the topsoil to promote ideal growing conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Curlex blankets consist of unique softly barbed, interlocking, curled, Aspen excelsior fibers. They are guaranteed weed seed free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most straight-line fiber blankets draw the line at 270 g/m2 (.50 lb/yd2), but not Curlex.  At just under 400 g/m2 (.75 lb/yd2), Curlex blankets bring 50% more erosion control fibers to your job site. Curlex blankets are available in natural Aspen or QuickGRASS® (green). Combine that with a roll that is wider than conventional blankets and you have today’s most effective and efficient multi-purpose biodegradable erosion control blanket.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Check out these specifications and compare to the competition:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Slopes to 2:1&lt;LI&gt;Channels to 7 ft/s&lt;LI&gt;Shear Stress to 1.75 po
